# Managed K8s Services

## Hypothetical Use Case
1. Web app with database
2. Available from browser with https
3. security for cluster
4. Data persistence for database
5. Dev and prod environment
6. **Setup as efficient as possible**

## Managed vs. Unmanaged K8s Cluster
For K8s cluster on a Cloud platform, you have 2 options:

1. Create own cluster from scratch:
    - You must install all binaries, processes, and manage everything yourself
    - Not practical when you want to setup quickly

2. Use a **Managed** K8s service:
    - Provided by cloud plaform; no need to create cluster from scratch
    - You just choose how many worker nodes
    - Docker runtime pre-installed
    - Provider creates and manages Manager nodes
    - Less effort and time

## Managed K8s Cluster with Linode K8s Engine as Example

1. Spin up K8s lcuster on cloud on LKE
2. Choose worker nodes with resources in Linod UI
3. Select region/data center
4. Connect to cluster from laptop with kubectl

### Data Persistence for your Cluster
1. Use Linode Storage Class
2. Linode creates persisten vols with physical storage

### Load Balancing K8s Cluster
Configure Services and Ingress:
1. Install and run INgressController on cluster:
    - Cloud proider has own load balancer implementation
    - For Linode, it's NodeBalancer. Provides public IP address in front of app server(s)
    - Can secure your conection with SSL Cert: configure with cert-manager
2. Use availability zones to move content closer to where your customers are
3. Move app from one cloud to another:
    - Usually services are tied to a specific provider; migrations difficult ("vendor lock-in")
4. Automating tasks should be done as much as possible using automation tools:
    - Terraform
    - Ansible
