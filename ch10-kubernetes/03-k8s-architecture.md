# Kubernetes Architecture

## Node Processes
 - **Worker Nodes**:
    1. Each node has multiple pods on it
    2. Do the actual work
    3. 3 processes must be installed on every node:
        - Container runtime (e.g. Docker, containerd)
        - Kubelet: interacts with both container runtime and node. Takes config and starts the pod with container inside
        - Kube Proxy: forwards requests between pods 

- **Manager Nodes**:
    1. 4 processes:
        - API Server: receives updates/queries from client to the cluster (to schedule new pods, new services, etc.) Validates requests and forwards to other processes as needed.
        - Scheduler: Intelligently decides which worker node to put the pod in based on which node has available resources.
        - Controller Manager: Detects cluster state changes and tries to restore state to declared condition
        - `etcd`: A key-value store of cluster state. Every change in the cluster gets stored in the key-value store.

A **cluster** includes (usually) multiple manager and worker nodes.
