# K8s Services

## What is a Service? Why do we Need Them?
In K8s, each pod has its own IP address. Pods get destroyed frequently. Services provide a persistent, stable IP address.

Services also provide load balancing. Service receives requests bound for pods and forward to available pods.

Loose coupling inside and outside of cluster. Facilitate communication inside and outside of cluster

## Service Types

1. ClusterIP Type: Default type. The ClusterIP service receives an IP address and port through which it is accessible within cluster. Service forwards request to one of the available pods in the cluster.

**How does the service know which Pod to forward the request to?** Through "selectors". Pods are identified via **selectors** in the config `.yaml` file via `selector`. Selectors are key-value pairs that act as **labels** for Pods. In service `.yaml`, define a `selector` attribute that matches the pod label.

**What if a pod has multiple ports?** In selector `.yaml` file, define a `targetPort` attribute. This finds all the pods that match `selector`, picks one port that matches randomly, and sends request to that pod on the `targetPort` port.

2. Headless Type: For use when **direct communication with a specific Pod is necessary**, e.g.:
    - Client wants to communicate w/ a specific Pod directly
    - Pods want to talk directly w/ other Pods
    - Example: deploying stateful applications like databases, Pod replicas will not be identical

    In this case, the client needs to know the IP address of each Pod. K8s allows clients to discover Pod addrs through DNS lookup; must set `ClusterIP` property to "None" to return Pod IP address.

3. Node Port Type: Creates a service accessible to **external** traffic on a static port attached to each Worker node. Browser requests come directly to Worker node (instead of Ingress). `nodePort` value must be betw 30000-32767.

4. LoadBalancer Type: Service becomes accessible externally through cloud provider's Load Balancing functionality.
